# Arduino-Water-Sensor-With-Led-Meter

Hi, my name is Rahmat Hidayat. I code for fun and sometimes share my code here so I can reuse it later. Feel free to use or modify this project. If you need help setting it up, follow this tutorial.

## Required Materials
- Arduino Uno
- Breadboard
- 3 Female wires
- 10 Jumper wires
- 3 Resistors (220Ω–330Ω recommended)
- Water Sensor Module
- 3 LED (With different color better)

## Wiring

### Water Sensor
- S -> A0
- + -> Any 5v source
- - -> Any ground

### LED
- LED -> Via resistor -> 9
- LED -> Via resistor -> 10
- LED -> Via resistor -> 11

## How to Use
1. Download the code from the `Tags` section.
2. Open it with Arduino IDE.
3. Select your board and port.
4. Upload.
5. Enjoy!
